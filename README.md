# pygame autoplayer

why scroll for videos when you can make a script that autoplays them back to back for you!!! this isnt the best way to do this but its funny and i was bored so,

### INSTRUCTIONS
- Put all video files into a folder inside that one called "vids"
- Install all libraries, with specific versions for moviepy==1.0.3 and pillow==9.5.0
- Adjust the values in CONSTANTS tab to fit your desires (don't be stupid)
    - If the videos are laggy, reduce the MAX_FPS and RESOLUTION.
